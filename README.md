A repo for the programming examples/exercises from "C++ Programming in easy steps" 
by Mike McGrath (ISBN: 978-1-84078-971-3) Copyright (c) 2022 by In Easy Steps Limited.

Given "not my code/copyright, just my typing" I'm not applying any licence to my "performance".
The publisher has (I assume) the same code available for download from their website, but 
since they don't allow "guest downloads", I'm unwilling to see what (if any) licence they
have applied to the code. I'll more than happily take this repository down should a 
representative of Mike McGrath or In Easy Steps Limited request such.
